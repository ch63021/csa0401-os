Start
    Input number of processes n and resources m
    Input Allocation[n][m] and Max[n][m]
    Calculate Need[n][m] = Max - Allocation
    Input Available[m]
    Initialize Finish[i] = False
    While exists process i with Need[i] <= Available and Finish[i] == False:
        Allocate its resources temporarily
        Available = Available + Allocation[i]
        Finish[i] = True
        Add process to safe sequence
    If all Finish[i] == True:
        System is in Safe State
    Else:
        Deadlock possible
Stop
