Start
    Input number of processes n
    For each process i in 1 to n:
        Input Burst Time (BT[i])
    Calculate Waiting Time (WT)
        WT[0] = 0
        For i = 1 to n-1:
            WT[i] = WT[i-1] + BT[i-1]
    Calculate Turnaround Time (TAT)
        For i = 0 to n-1:
            TAT[i] = WT[i] + BT[i]
    Calculate Average WT and Average TAT
