Start
    Input number of processes n
    Input Burst Time (BT[i]) for each process
    Input Time Quantum (Q)
    Initialize remaining time = BT[i]
    time = 0
    While (any process still incomplete)
        For each process i:
            If remaining time > 0:
                If remaining time > Q:
                    time = time + Q
                    remaining time = remaining time - Q
                Else:
                    time = time + remaining time
                    Turnaround Time (TAT[i]) = time
                    Waiting Time (WT[i]) = TAT[i] - BT[i]
                    remaining time = 0
    Calculate Average WT and TAT
